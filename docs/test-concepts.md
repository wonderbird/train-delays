# Test Concepts

## Acceptance Tests

Features and scenarios are written using the Gherkin DSL and executed with [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/).

The following articles describe the used concepts:

- Mois√©s Macero: [Cucumber Tests in Spring Boot with Dependency Injection](https://thepracticaldeveloper.com/cucumber-tests-spring-boot-dependency-injection/)
- baeldung: [Asserting Log Messages With JUnit](https://www.baeldung.com/junit-asserting-logs)

## API Verification

This application uses [Pact](https://pact.io/) tests to verify that the timetable api is consumed and parsed correctly.
